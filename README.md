![An image demonstrating the glyphs of the variant font.](test.png)

A font inspired by the [Godot Engine's](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) editor icons.


I am not a professional font designer, this font was made for fun and in the hopes that it will be useful to others, especially game developers and plugin developers using Godot.
